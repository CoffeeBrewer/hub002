# Workspace Starter

This repository provides a minimal static workspace you can open directly in your browser or extend with your preferred tooling.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Entry point that references the starter styles and script.
- `src/styles.css`: Basic styling for the landing page and badges.
- `src/script.js`: Lightweight script that numbers the getting-started steps.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the starter page.
2. Customize styles in `src/styles.css` and add functionality in `src/script.js`.
3. If you want live reload, serve the folder with any static server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`).

This setup is intentionally simple so you can adapt it to any stack.
